# DogvCat_Using_transfer_learning-mobilenet-
This is a model which has been trained using 1000 images of dogs and cats on a pre-trained ssd-mobilenet using transfer learning

First create a json file and a h5 file which contains the architecture and weights of the model . This step is not required if you are going to train and execute the model in the same machine . To create the json and h5 file run the training_the_model file . Then load the model in the jupyter notebook and perform classification of dogs and cats using webcam
